Re: IBRD Loan 89210-IN (India: Additional Financing for the Uttarakhand Disaster Recovery
Project)
Additional Instructions: Disbursement and Financial Information Letter.

Dear Mr. Sukhbir,

I refer to the Loan Agreement between India (the “Borrower’’) and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the “World Bank”) for the above-referenced project, dated March 5,
2019. The General Conditions, as defined in the Loan Agreement, provide that the World Bank may issue
additional instructions regarding the withdrawal of the proceeds of Loan 89210-IN (“Loan”), and specify
certain financial management reporting and audit requirements. This letter (“Disbursement and Financial
Information Letter” or “DFIL’’), as revised from time to time, constitutes such additional instructions.

The Disbursement Guidelines for Investment Project Financing dated February 2017,
(‘Disbursement Guidelines”) are available in the Bank’s public website at https://www.worldbank.org and
its secure website “Client Connection” at https://clientconnection.worldbank.org. The Disbursement
Guidelines are an integral part of this Disbursement and Financial Reporting Letter, and the manner in
which the provisions in the guidelines apply to the Loan is specified below.

I. Disbursement Arrangements, Withdrawal and Reporting of Loan Proceeds.
(i) Disbursement Arrangements.

Instructions (Schedule 1). The table in Schedule 1 provides the disbursement methods,
information on registration of authorized signatures, processing of withdrawal applications, instructions on
supporting documentation, the closing date, and the disbursement deadline date.

(ii) Electronic Delivery. Refer to section 10.01 (c) of the General Conditions:

The World Bank may permit the Borrower to electronically deliver applications (with supporting
documents) through the Bank’s web-based portal (https://clientconnection.worldbank.org) “Client
Connection”. This option may be effected if: (a) the Borrower has designated in writing, its officials who
are authorized to sign and deliver Applications and to receive Secure Identification Credentials (“SIDC’’)
from the Bank for the purpose of delivering such Applications by electronic means; and (b) all such officials
designated by the Borrower have registered as users of “Client Connection”. The designated officials may
deliver Applications electronically by completing the Form 2380, which is accessible through “Client
Connection”. The Borrower may continue to exercise the option of preparing and delivering Applications
in paper form. The Bank reserves the right and may, in its sole discretion, temporarily or permanently
disallow the electronic delivery of Applications by the Borrower. By designating officials to use SIDC and
by choosing to deliver the Applications electronically, the Borrower confirms through the authorized
signatory letter its agreement to: (a) abide by the Terms and Conditions of Use of Secure Identification
Credentials in connection with Use of Electronic Means to Process Applications and Supporting
Documentation, available in the Bank's public website at https://worldbank.org and “Client Connection”;
and (b) to cause such official to abide by those terms and conditions.

II. Financial Information.

(i) Financial Reports. The Borrower shall cause the State Government of Uttarakhand to prepare and
furnish to the Bank not later than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar semester, interim unaudited
financial reports (IFR) for the Project covering the semester.

(ii) Audits. Each audit of the Financial Statements shall cover the period of one (1) fiscal year of the
Borrower, commencing with the fiscal year in which the first withdrawal was made. The audited Financial
Statements for each such period shall be furnished to the Bank not later than six (6) months after the end of
such period.

III. Other Important Information

For additional information on disbursement arrangements, please refer to the Loan Handbook
available on the Bank’s public website and “Client Connection”. The Bank recommends that you register

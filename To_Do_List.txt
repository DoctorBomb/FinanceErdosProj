Bear Group: To Do List

1. Extract whole dataset to text 
-- pdfminer vs pymupdf [Other libraries?]
-- pytesseract [Other libraries?]

2. Preprocess Data
--Extract Loan Amounts
--Extract Interest Rate/Lifetime of Loan
--Extract Country
--Extract Project Description
--Extract any other information?


3. Clean Dataset
-- Normalize Loan amounts (same currency ,account for inflation)
-- Tokenize Project Description
-- Get other data externally (GDP or CLI [Cost of living index])
-- Scale necessary data [log scale, minmax scale, normalize]
-- Other ways to clean?

4. Clustering Data/Visualization [I'd be happy to do this step as I have
   already started to work on it --Kash]
-- Word2Vec vs Doc2Vec
-- k-means, PCA, t-SNE, UMAP [Dimension reduction for clustering]
-- Regional Analysis perhaps? (similar to previous group)

Possible other Analyses (Feel free to write your own suggestions!)
5. Predict Loan Amount from other features

6. Determine Impact of Loans on country economy over course of loan term

7. Predict later years (GDP, CPI, different for each sector?)

Bear Group: To Do List

1. Extract whole dataset to text 
--pdfminer vs pymupdf [Other libraries?] [DONE]
--pytesseract [Other libraries?] [DONE]

2. Preprocess Data
-H-Extract Loan Amounts [KEVIN] > Let me know when ready so I can merge (-Kash)
--Extract Date [DONE]
-H-Extract Country [ATTILIO] > Let me know when ready so I can merge (-Kash)
-H-Extract Project Description [KASH]
-M-Extract Interest Rate
-M-Extract Lifetime/Tenure of Loan
-M-Extract Amortization/Schedule
--Extract any other information?

External Information
-H-GDP [UPLOAD CSV FILE FROM LINK]
-L-Inflation
-L-Currency Rates

3. Clean Dataset
-- Normalize Loan amounts (same currency ,account for inflation)
-- Tokenize Project Description
-- Get other data externally (GDP or CLI [Cost of living index])
-- Scale necessary data [log scale, minmax scale, normalize]
-- Other ways to clean?

4. Clustering Data/Visualization [I'd be happy to do this step as I have
   already started to work on it --Kash]
-- Word2Vec vs Doc2Vec [DONE]
-L- k-means, PCA, t-SNE, UMAP [Dimension reduction for clustering]
-H- DBCSan (PCA and Doc2vec) [KASH AND BINGJIN]
-H- Country/region visualize [KEVIN AND ATTILIO]

Possible other Analyses (Feel free to write your own suggestions!)
5. Predict Loan Amount from other features

6. Determine Impact of Loans on country economy over course of loan term

****7. Predict later years (GDP, CPI, different for each sector?)

8. Richer vs Poorer countries
--stability
--freedom of speech/armed conflict

9. Regression/Predictors within each sector (AFTER clustering by sector)

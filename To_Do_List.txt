Bear Group: To Do List

1. Extract whole dataset to text 
--pdfminer vs pymupdf [Other libraries?] [DONE]
--pytesseract [Other libraries?] [DONE]

2. Preprocess Data
--Extract Loan Amounts [KEVIN] > Let me know when ready so I can merge (-Kash)
--Extract Date [DONE]
--Extract Country [ATTILIO] > Let me know when ready so I can merge (-Kash)
--Extract Project Description [KASH]
-M-Extract Interest Rate
-M-Extract Lifetime/Tenure of Loan
-M-Extract Amortization/Schedule
--Extract any other information?

External Information
--GDP [UPLOAD CSV FILE FROM LINK]
-L-Inflation
-L-Currency Rates
--Determine "stability of country"

3. Clean Dataset
-- Normalize Loan amounts (same currency ,account for inflation)
-- Tokenize Project Description
-- Get other data externally (GDP or CLI [Cost of living index])
-- Scale necessary data [log scale, minmax scale, normalize]
-- Other ways to clean?

4. Clustering Data/Visualization [I'd be happy to do this step as I have
   already started to work on it --Kash]
-- Word2Vec vs Doc2Vec [DONE]
-L- k-means, PCA, t-SNE, UMAP [Dimension reduction for clustering]
-H- DBCSan (PCA and Doc2vec) [KASH AND BINGJIN]
-H- Country/region visualize [KEVIN AND ATTILIO]
--Pre-trained GLoVe (k-means) clustering (BINJIN)
--LDA (KASH) --> Check manually (20 samples)
--push project name main



5. GDP analysis (attilio)
-- Got Loan model


6. Regression? Target-Loan Amount?

7. Visualization Branch
--Kevin saved us with Tableau!



Possible other Analyses (Feel free to write your own suggestions!)
5. Predict Loan Amount from other features

6. Determine Impact of Loans on country economy over course of loan term

****7. Predict later years (GDP, CPI, different for each sector?)

8. Richer vs Poorer countries
--stability
--freedom of speech/armed conflict

9. Regression/Predictors within each sector (AFTER clustering by sector)

10. Compare sector with loan term (how long)
